# Data Engineering Assessment

## General Interpretation of the task at hand

- We are receiving incremental-transactional data twice a day
- Client data is not incremental, it can safely replace existing subscriber data.
- First, we need to clean both sources.
- My understanding is that we need to maintain a db table of subscribers, overwriting it each time, with the new data.
- On the other hand, transactions, enriched by the joining with the
subscribers table, will be stored in a columnar format ready for analytics (parquet)
